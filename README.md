# RTSP grabber with GStreamer with Docker as a Greengrass component for CV Inference to Count People with Gluon CV

This project consists of three parts:

1. A Docker container to take an RTSP stream and extract the latest frame to a JPEG file
2. Building and deploying that container as a Greengrass v2 Component
3. A Gluon CV component to count people in that frame -- emitting the count, the bounding boxes, and frame rate stats over MQTT

This project targets Linux hosts and was developed using Linux and Mac desktop environments. 

## Part 1 - RTSP Stream to Still in a Docker Container

Using Computer Vision models often means acquiring images from RTSP sources. GStreamer provides a flexible and effective means to acquire those sources and render the current frame. As [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) can require a number of libraries and be a bit tricky to work with, using Docker helps to manage these dependencies.

_Prerequisites_:

* [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Step 1. Build the Docker image

The `RUN` command of the `Dockerfile` will install all the packages needed. The current build is based on Ubuntu 20.04, but it is certainly possible to create a smaller, more targetted image. 

Note the export of the Time Zone -- the GStreamer install will pause (and fail) if this is not set. 

1. set `TZ` to your [time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

the `CMD` provides the exec style params to the `ENTRYPOINT` -- these can be overridden by the docker invocation. Note the `location` parameter giving the RTSP source and the second `location` parameter giving the Docker-side path for the frame results.

2. customize the `location` for the `rtspsrc` for your source.

_Make sure you have the right source (IP, port, user, password) by using [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) *and* with `telnet`, `nc`, or other from the Docker host to ensure the stream can be accessed._

3. (Optional) modify the `location` parameter for the `multifilesink` plugin to set the location of the file that the pipeline will write.

4. Now, build the image:

```bash
docker build --rm -t <name> .
```

The `--rm` switch will remove any previous builds (which you may accumulate if you change the `CMD` parameters or other settings). However, orphaned images can still accumulate. 

**List Images**
List images with

```bash
docker images
```

**Prune unused images**
```bash
docker system prune
```

### Step 2. Test the Docker Image

1. Start the docker container with

```bash
docker run -v /tmp:/data --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" <name>
```

This will start the container, mapping the host's `/tmp` dir to the container's `/data` dir. New files will be created with the current user/group. 

**Normal output**
```
Progress: (open) Retrieving server options
Progress: (open) Retrieving media info
Progress: (request) SETUP stream 0
Progress: (request) SETUP stream 1
Progress: (open) Opened Stream
Setting pipeline to PLAYING ...
New clock: GstSystemClock
Progress: (request) Sending PLAY request
Progress: (request) Sending PLAY request
Progress: (request) Sent PLAY request
Redistribute latency...
```

2. Check the output with
```bash
# modify as needed if you changed the output location
ls -l /tmp/frame.jpg
```
and observe the user, group, timestamp, etc. 

3. Open the file in an image viewer and verify correctness.
_Tip_: on Ubuntu hosts, the command `eog /tmp/frame.jpg` will open a window with the image--it should refresh as the pipeline writes new frames.

_Troubleshooting_
Try executing the GStreamer pipeline interactively.

```bash
# launch the container in interactive mode
docker run -v  /tmp:/data --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -it --entrypoint /bin/bash gst
```
_(Errors about not having a name are normal.)_

Execute pipelines manually
```bash
# same command as in the Dockerfile
gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc location="rtsp://<ip>:<port>/h264?username=<user>&password=<pass>" ! queue ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! jpegenc ! multifilesink location="/data/frame.jpg"

# capture the stream to a file until Ctrl-C cancels 
gst-launch-1.0 -e rtspsrc location="rtsp://192.168.5.193:554/h264?username=admin&password=123456" ! queue ! rtph264depay ! h264parse ! mp4mux ! filesink location=/data/file.mp4
```

Seeing errors about plugins missing or misconfigured?
```bash
# no rtspsrc? 
gst-inspect-1.0 rtspsrc
```

Compose additional pipelines, consulting the [GStreamer Plugin Reference](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/plugins_doc.html?gi-language=c)

### (Optional) Step 3. Use a RAM disk for the images

As the GStreamer pipeline will (re)write the frame file 30x/second, using a RAM Disk for these will save power and disk cycles as well as improve overall performance. When inference is added, we can extend the use of this RAM Disk.

* create entry in `/etc/fstab` 

```
tmpfs /tmp/gst tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,noexec,mode=1777,size=32M 0 0
```

creates 32M RAM disk in `/tmp/gst`...  the mapped volume for docker

Mount the RAM Disk with

```bash
sudo mount -a
```

You may need to `chown` the user/group of the created tmp dir **OR** execute subsequent inference with `sudo` **OR** modify the `fstab` entry to set the user/group.

## Part 2. Build the Greengrass Component


## Part 3. Perform inference with a Pretrained model and GluonCV

We can use a pre-trained GluonCV model to detect objects in the frame and then classify those objects. Those predictions (scores, bounding boxes, etc.) can then be used to "Count" the number of detected objects of a class (e.g. "person"). 

Consulting the [Gluon model zoo comparison](https://cv.gluon.ai/model_zoo/detection.html), we select [ssd_512_resnet50_v1_voc](https://cv.gluon.ai/model_zoo/detection.html#id1) as being a good combination of effectively accurate, moderate model size, and was trained with the [Pascal VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/#history) to predict 20 classes of object--including 'person'. 

These steps follow the [MXNet Tutorial](https://cv.gluon.ai/build/examples_detection/demo_ssd.html#sphx-glr-build-examples-detection-demo-ssd-py) for pre-trainted SSD models.

1. install packages 

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2. configure the parameters of the `infer.py` script. 

| variable | usage |
| --- | --- |
| source_file | host-side path of the frame grabbed in Part 1 |
| max_frame_rate | how 'fast' should the script 'check' for new frames |
| ctx | use CPU or GPU for model inference |

3. (re)start the gstreamer pipeline if needed as in Part 1

4. run the inference

```bash
python3 ./infer.py
```
